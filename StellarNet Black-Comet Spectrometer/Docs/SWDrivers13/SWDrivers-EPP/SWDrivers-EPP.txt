Enhanced Parallel Port interface (EPP)
Installation Instructions for Win2000 or WinXP 
Sorry, StellarNet no longer provides support
for parallel port installations.  We recommend
using our USB2EPP cable.  

EPP-PCMCIA card <Quatech SPP-100> for notebooks.
EPP-PCI card <Lava Computer> for desktops.
Integrated printer port with EPP mode in BIOS. (note*1)
-------------------------------------------------------

1. Install SpectraWiz for NT/00/XP, but do not start.
   If you don't have a diskette, download from 
   www.StellarNet-Inc.com.
  
   When downloaded, password = same name as the file,
   with lower case, omit the leading "s" and
   trailing file extension.  For example SW3-1NT.exe
   password = "w3-1nt".

   The default spectrometer hex port address is 278h,
   with a check box selection for LAVA PCI card.  This
   should be un-checked if using the EPP-PCMCIA.
   
>> Do not start SpectraWiz until a driver is installed.  
>> The port address setup in SpectraWiz may need
>> to be changed the the port address configured by the
>> Windows device manager such as  (lpt1) 378h, 
>> (lpt2) 278h, and (lpt3) 260h
    
2a.Install driver for WinXP (also works on Win2000).
   If you don't have a diskette, download from
   www.StellarNet-Inc.com and unzip to floppy.
   password = "wxp".

2b.If the PC card was previously installed, it will
   appear in Device Manager under Ports (COM & LPT).
   Then use the device manager to select "Update driver"
   as found on the Driver panel.

   If you have not installed the PC card, then insert   
   now and you should get "New hardward found" message.
   
>> When prompted for driver, DO NOT allow Windows to 
>> search for driver, select look ONLY on floppy disk.

   If prompted with list, select "EPP-PCMCIA card" for
   Quatech or "Standard port types" for LAVA PCI card.
 
2c.After driver install completes, a new device will
   appear on the Device Manager list (near bottom) as
   "WinRT Devices".  Open the parallel port device
   and verify the driver provider = "StellarNet Inc" and
   check the "resources tab" for its port address.
   Make note of the port address assigned to setup
   SpectraWiz for the same address. 
    
3. Start SpectraWiz -> Setup -> Interface port and detector.
   The default port is 278 hex, however this should be
   changed to the same port shown in the Device manager.
   Uncheck the LAVA card box if using the PCMCIA card.

>> Exit SpectraWiz and re-boot.

   Re-start SpectraWiz to see real-time spectral graphs.

   When needed, download the latest SpectraWiz version from
   our website as "SWUpdate.exe".  Just click to install,
   no password is needed.

   If no spectra is displayed, then try the following:

    a. For EPP-PCMCIA (Quatech) cards on notebook computers
       Use device manager to select another available interrupt.
       Even though SpectraWiz does not use interrupts, the card
       may have problems that Windows cannot detect. 

    b. For EPP-PCI (Lava) cards on desktop computers
       Install the LAVA2000.reg driver found in the SpectraWiz folder.
       Just click on it to install, then re-start computer from
       power off.  

note*1
------
Must set the printer to EPP mode using computers BIOS menu.
The BIOS menu is started BEFORE the Windows screen appears.  
If there is no option for EPP mode on the BIOS menu, then 
you cannot use the integrated printer port.
