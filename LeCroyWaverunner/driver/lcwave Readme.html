<h4>2. Required Software</h4>
Some software components need to be installed before using this instrument driver. The minimum versions of 
these components are listed below, and can be downloaded from the Download Site.

VISA 3.0
LeCroy VICP VISA Passport (for Ethernet communication only; not required for GPIB operation)

Note: 

VISA has additional software requirements. For example, unless you are using a serial interface, 
NI-VISA requires that NI-488.2 and/or NI-VXI be installed on your system. Check with VISA help for additional 
support software and hardware requirements.

The LeCroy VICP VISA Passport can be obtained from the Software Utilities section of LeCroy's website.


<h4>3. Installation Instructions</h4>

The lcwave driver should be installed under your LabVIEW installations
instr.lib folder, in a folder called lcwave. This is most easily done by
opening the lcwave.zip file using Winzip. From the Winzip main window,
select Extract, and in the subsequent window find and select your LabVIEW
instr.lib folder. The lcwave.zip archive includes path information
beginning with the lcwave folder, so there is no need to create this folder
yourself. Make sure that the options "All files/folders in archive" and
"Use folder names" are selected, and then click the Extract button.

Within the lcwave directory you can find the menu files and VI libraries
that make up the instrument driver. The menu files allow you to view the
instrument driver VIs from the Functions palette. The VI libraries contain
the instrument driver VIs.

This Readme file will also be extracted to the lcwave folder.


<h4>4. Using the Instrument Driver</h4>

LabVIEW:

To verify communication with your instrument and test a typical
programmatic instrument operation, you should first open the examples
contained within the Examples function palette of the instrument driver.
Look over each of the controls and set them appropriately. Generally, with
the exception of the address field, the defaults for most controls will be
sufficient for your first run. You will need to set the instrument resource
name appropriately. After running the VI, check to see that reasonable data
was returned and an error was not reported in the error cluster.

After you have verified basic communication with your instrument, you might
want to customize instrument control for your needs. If your application
needs are similar to the Getting Started or Example VI, the simplest means
of creating a customized VI is to save a copy of the Getting Started or
Example VI by selecting Save As from the File menu. You can then modify
this example to meet your specific needs.

For more details, reference the <i>LabVIEW Help</i> under <i>Help » VI, Function, &
How-To Help</i>.


<h4>5. Known Issues</h4>
To report issues or provide feedback about this instrument driver, please send an email to <a 
href="mailto:instrument.drivers@ni.com">instrument.drivers@ni.com</a>.

This driver supports most of the functionality common to all supported instrument series.  It does not support 
all functionality specific to a particular instrument series.

<b>REV 2.0 12/1/2006</b> 
Modified by Alan Blankman (LeCroy Corporation)
This version includes no critical fixes, but includes some minor improvements as well as many useful new subVIs.
Modified VIs:
lcwave Initialize.vi: Fixed logic that determines which error cluster is passed.
lcwave decode IDN query response.vi: added "Model Found" boolean indicator to simplify the error logic in Initialize.vi, added model numbers of new oscilloscopes.
lcwave Default Instrument Setup.vi: updated VI: removed code that sets up registers for an SRQ. This will be moved to a new VI. The driver doesn’t currently include wait for SRQ functionality.
lcwave Get Descriptor.vi: improved its ruggedness and added the decoding of the horizontal offset and trigger time.
lcwave Fetch Waveform.vi: removed code to choose between byte vs word mode to avoid incorrect use of byte mode.
lcwave Read Command Error.vi: Improve error reporting.
lcwave Read Device Dependent Error.vi: Added error handling to match changes previously made to lcwave Read Command Error.vi and to improve error reporting.
lcwave Read Execution Error.vi: Added error handling to match changes previously made to lcwave Read Command Error.vi and to improve error reporting.
lcwave Read Single Sequence.vi: Changed VI Description, which said that the VI calls Fetch Segment. (It calls Fetch Waveform)
lcwave VI Tree.vi: Updated to include changes.
Lcwave Acquire Waveform.vi: Added controls to make Reset and AutoSetup optional
 
New VIs:
lcwave Configure Display Priority.vi: Controls the performance slider.  Throughput can be increased significantly when setting the priority to Analysis. Added to Configure palette.
lcwave Configure Save Waveform.vi: Configures all controls on the oscilloscope’s “Save Waveform” screen.  Includes flexibility for entry of any trace name.
lcwave Save Waveform.vi: Executes a Save Waveform action when saving to either a  memory trace or to disk (local to the scope or to a networked drive).  Replaces lcwave Store to Memory
lcwave Save-Recall Instrument Setup from file.vi: Executes a Save Panel Setup or Recall Panel Setup action that saves/loads panel setup from the scopes hard drive or from a networked drive.
lcwave Read Waveform Measurement was added as a polymorphic vi with the following subvis:
	lcwave Read Waveform Measurement (Standard).vi: Reads back one of the “standard” waveform measurements. Does not require the user to configure a “Px” parameter.

<b>REV 2.1 08/11/2008</b>
Modified by Alan Blankman (LeCroy Corporation)
This version includes no critical fixes, but includes both major and minor fixes and improvements as well as several useful new subVIs.

New VIs:
lcwave Transfer File: Transfers a file from the oscilloscope's hard drive to a remote PC
lcwave Get Screenshot: Grabs a screenshot and transfers the image data to the remote PC in a variety of image formats
lcwave Configure Measure Mode: Configures the measurement mode to either My Measure, Standard Horizontal or Standard Vertical.  
lcwave Configure Input Path: Selects whether to use the A or B input. (Only needed for certain WP, SDA and DDA 7Zi models.)
lcwave Acquire and Read MyMeasurements: New example

Revised VIs:
lcwave Read Waveform Measurement (Px Statistics): Corrected parsing for non-standard parameters
lcwave Read Waveform Measurement (Standard): Improved parsing to avoid potential Scan from String error
lcwave Read: Removed TCP/IP case, since users should use the VICP passport for TCP/IP connections instead of NI's TCPIP passport, which isn't supported
lcwave Write: Removed TCP/IP case, since users should use the VICP passport for TCP/IP connections instead of NI's TCPIP passport, which isn't supported
lcwave decode IDN query response: Added models WE100H, WS24XS, M series and new WavePro, SDA and DDA 7Zi models
lcwave Configure Channel: Added coupling options AC and DC to support probes, moved VDIV ahead of OFST for ruggedness

lcwave Fetch All Segments: Revised to increase speed by not requiring separate reads for each segment.
lcwave Configure Trigger (polymorphic): Modified subVI's for proper handling of Ext and Ext10 sources. See VI descriptions and block diagram comments for more information. Users are recommended *not* to use the "External" selection, but instead to use "Ext" or "Ext10" explicitly.
lcwave Transfer Selected Waveform: Fix instructions to read "VICP::" instead of "VICP:"
lcwave Fetch Max Min Waveform: Changed T0 to be "0"
lcwave decode trigtime: Modified to work with both Hi/Lo and Lo/Ho comm_orders
lcwave Get Descriptor: Modified to use new version of decode trigtime	
lcwave Get Waveform: Added Custom Source ID,  inserted "+1" so that the VI also returns the last point (which happens to be off grid.)
lcwave Sequence Acquisition: Removed autosetup, set Initialize options to False
lcwave Acquire Waveform: Added instructions
lcwave Acquire Waveform In Loop.vi: Added options to make a Reset and Autosetup optional, added instructions
lcwave Initialize: Reduced timeout to 10 seconds from 30 seconds, which was unnecessarily long for Initializing.
