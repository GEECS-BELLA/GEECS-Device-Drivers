<br>
REV 1.6.0, 10/15/2021<br>
Updated by: Satnam Singh Brar and Soleil Lapierre, Vancouver, BC.<br>
<ul>
	<li>Added a new <code>Initialize TCPIP</code> VI that allows easy connection to Zaber devices that are accessible over your network using TCP/IP.
		This includes new Zaber X-MCC Series controllers that have an Ethernet connector, or existing RS-232 devices connected to the network using 
		Ethernet-to-serial bridge hardware or software.
	<li>Added a new <code>Format TCPIP VISA Resource Name</code> utility VI to assist in creating a TCP/IP connection string from a host name or IP address and a port number.
	<li>The following simple examples have been added to show usage of the new TCP/IP VIs. They can be found in the "Example Finder"
		<ul>
			<li><code>Zaber A Series TCPIP Move</code>
			<li><code>Zaber A Series TCPIP Commands and Responses</code>
		</ul>
	<li>Some palettes have been reorganized to eliminate empty spaces.
	<li>Added descriptions to all controls and indicators in the example VIs.
	<li>Data limit enforcement has been removed from all controls that previously had it. The limits still apply to devices; consult the documentation for legal values.
	<li>Added valid range and default value documentation to all relevant controls that were missing it.
	<li>Corrected some spelling mistakes in VI documentation.
</ul>
<br>
REV 1.5.0, 07/24/2020<br>
Updated by: Soleil Lapierre, Vancouver, BC.<br>
<ul>
	<li>The private Read (Single Response) VI, which is used by most other VIs in this driver, has been updated to be able to handle device responses
		consisting of multiple packets, a possibility that was introduced to the Zaber ASCII Protocol with the launch of four-axis controllers.
	<lI>Bug fix: The Response String Array output of the Send Command VI will now include the message type identifier character at the start of each string
		for info and alert messages. Reply messages will omit the '@' identifier as they are the default expectation.
</ul>
<br>
REV 1.4.0, 05/28/2020<br>
Updated by: Soleil Lapierre, Vancouver, BC.<br>
<ul>
	<li>Multiple changes to support Zaber's new X-MCC line of controllers and new Firmware version 7:
	<ul>
		<li>Added the Write Analog Output and Read Analog Output VIs, as some Zaber devices now have analog output ports. The I/O example program has been 
			updated to demonstrate the use of these VIs.
		<li>The Enable Lockstep VI now supports having more than two axes in a lockstep group, where the device has more than two axes.
		<li>Added the Set Lockstep Tolerance VI to allow customization of twist tolerance on multi-axis systems.
		<li>The Open Stream VI is joined by Open Stream (FW7) VI, which takes strings for the axis inputs instead of integers in order to allow specification 
			of lockstep groups as stream axes, and a new Open Stream (Polymorphic) VI, which selects from the other two.
		<li>Added Stream Line On Axis Subset, Stream Circle On Axis Subset and Stream Arc On Axis Subset VIs that allow execution of these stream
			path segments on subsets of a stream's configured axes.
	</ul>
</ul>
<br>
REV 1.3.0, 03/02/2020<br>
Updated by: Soleil Lapierre, Vancouver, BC.<br>
<ul>
	<li>The Set Speed and Acceleration VI has been made obsolete due to mismatched unit conversions that cannot be fixed without a breaking change. 
		Please use the new, separate Set Speed and Set Acceleration VIs instead.
	<li>The Convert Acceleration Units to Device Units and the Convert Device Units to Acceleration Units VIs have been made obsolete in order to make
		the list of acceleration units of measure correspond to those of the speed and position unit conversion VIs. Please use the new Convert Acceleration 
		to Device Units and Convert Device Units to Acceleration VIs instead. The new ones do not support units of microsteps per second squared.
	<li>Fixed possible infinite loops in the Poll Until Idle VI and the private Read (Multiple Responses) VI if errors occur before they execute.
</ul>
<br>
REV 1.2.2, 11/21/2019<br>
Updated by: Soleil Lapierre, Vancouver, BC.<br>
<ul>
    <li>Fixed bugs in the Convert Acceleration Units to Device Units and the Convert Device Units to Acceleration Units VIs that were producing incorrect conversions of acceleration quantities.</li>
</ul>
<br>
REV 1.2.1, 03/01/2019<br>
Updated by: Mike McDonald, Vancouver, BC.<br>
<ul>
    <li>Fixed a bug in the private Read (Single Response) VI that was sometimes causing extra whitespace to appear in one of the outputs.</li>
</ul>
<br>
REV 1.2, 10/05/2018<br>
Updated by: Mike McDonald and Soleil Lapierre, Vancouver, BC.<br>
<ul>
    <li>Various VIs have been updated to use 64-bit integers to represent device positions, 
    velocities and accelerations. In all cases this change should be backwards compatible,
    but using 64 bits where optional is recommended for users of high resolution devices such 
    as direct drive linear stages.
        <ul>
            <li>Added new versions of the following VIs with 64-bit inputs or outputs for 
			    compatibility with Zaber firmware version 7 or later. In the cases where inputs
				were changed to 64 bits, the existing VI remains 32-bit and a new polymorphic 
				version of the VIs has been added.
				Using the polymorphic version is recommended in new programs for future 
				compatibility. In the cases where only new outputs were added, the new 
				outputs are on previously unoccupied pins.
                <ul>
                    <li>Lockstep Move</li>
                    <li>Lockstep Move at Velocity</li>
                    <li>Set Virtual Axis Speed</li>
                    <li>Virtual Axis Move</li>
                    <li>Virtual Axis Move at Velocity</li>
                    <li>Get Virtual Axis Info</li>
                    <li>Set Stream Speed and Acceleration</li>
                    <li>Stream Line</li>
                    <li>Stream Circle</li>
                    <li>Stream Arc</li>
                    <li>All six unit conversion VIs under Utility / Low-Level.</li>
                </ul>
            <li>The Read Current Position VI can now internally handle device positions outside the range of a 32-bit integer.
            The output type is still a double, which means that precision may be lost when dealing with very large numbers.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
	<li>Updated the private Read (Single Response).vi to handle more possible errors, including:</li>
	     <ul>
            <li>Validating checksums if the comm.checksum setting is enabled.</li>
            <li>Checking that the response starts with an expected Message Type (@, !, or #).</li>
            <li>Checking that the Reply Flag is an expected value (OK or RJ).</li>
            <li>Returning an empty Response Cluster if the response is an Alert or Info message.</li>
         </ul>
	</li>
	<li>Added the private Validate Checksum.vi.</li>
	<li>Added a First Response Bundle output to the private Read (Multiple Responses).vi and Request.vi,
    and added a First Response Bundle output to Send Command.vi	and First Response Data output to Get Setting.vi.</li>
	<li>Updated all subVIs and examples to used these new outputs where applicable.</li>
    <li>Fixed a bug in the circle part of the Streaming example; it was using the arc endpoint
    coordinates as the circle center by accident.</li>
	<li>Changed the Get Device IDs VI to suppress expected errors when attempting to get the
	peripheral ID from devices that don't have one.</li>
    <li>Corrected incorrect information in Device ID Lookup VI documentation about the location of the 
    associated example CSV data file.</li>
    <li>The format of the CSV file used by the Device ID Lookup VI has changed, and the online
    downloadable example updated accordingly. The VI now supports devices that do not have a
    resolution setting, such as direct drive stages, and will correctly report their microstep
    size.</li>
</ul>
<br>
REV 1.1, 06/20/2017<br>

	    provide the ability to look up device properties in CSV tables to get their names,
	    motion types and step sizes. A Python script to generate the tables can
