<h3>2. Required Software</h3>
Some software components need to be installed before using this instrument driver. The minimum versions of these components are listed below, and can be downloaded from the Download Site.

VISA 3.2 or later

Refer to the <i>LabVIEW Help</i> for more information about software requirements. You access the <i>LabVIEW Help</i> by selecting <i>Help»Search the LabVIEW Help</i>.
<h3>3. Known Issues</h3>
To report issues or provide feedback about this instrument driver, please send an email to <a href="mailto:instrument.drivers@ni.com">instrument.drivers@ni.com</a>.

Wait for Operation Complete clears the instrument's event log. The practical result of this is that all instrument errors are lost.

The digital waveform graph indicator in the Read Multiple Digital Waveforms vi autosizes incorrectly the first time when there are more than one digital channel is selected. Re-running the vi fixes the issue.

The Trigger On parameters "TX Parity Error" and "RX Parity Error" do not have programming interface commands in place therefore they aren't implemented in the driver.
